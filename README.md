# SwitchCraft
A test application (for the Switch) that I made to see how easy it was to render a 3D environment with lines. Then I made a Minecraft clone out of it.

## Controls
 - Left/Right Joystick: Look around
 - A: Jump
 - B: Walk backwards
 - X: Walk forward
 - Y: Place/Remove block
 - -: Change between placing and removing
 - +: Quit application
